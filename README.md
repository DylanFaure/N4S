Epitech Project.

- Download CoppeliaSim
- Put the CoppeliaSim folder on the n4s folder
- Use the command ./Coppeliasim_Edu_V4_0_0_Ubuntu18_04/coppeliasim.sh to launch Coppeliasim
- In the Coppeliasim windows, go to "File" and open a track in the folder name "scene"
- Open another window in the n4s folder and use ./pipes.sh to launch the car
- Watch the sequence in the Coppeliasim window
(If the track is infinite (don't have any ending wall) you need to stop the simulation when you want)
